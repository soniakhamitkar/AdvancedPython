# **Advanced Python Projects**  

This repository contains a collection of **data analysis and machine learning projects** implemented in **Python**. Each project explores real-world datasets using advanced techniques such as **data wrangling, visualization, sentiment analysis, and predictive modeling**.  

## **Contents**  

### 📌 Data Analysis & Visualization  
- **Climate Change in Florida** (`Climate Change Florida.ipynb`)  
  - Analyzes temperature trends and sea-level rise in Florida using historical climate data.  
  - Uses `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` for time-series analysis and visualization.  

- **U.S. Flight Data Analysis** (`Flights_Data_Analysis.ipynb`)  
  - Examines flight delays, cancellations, and performance trends.  
  - Utilizes `pandas` and `matplotlib` to extract key insights.  

- **World Education Dataset Analysis** (`World Education Dataset Final Analysis.ipynb`)  
  - Investigates global education statistics, literacy rates, and school enrollment patterns.  
  - Features interactive visualizations with `plotly` and `seaborn`.  

### 📌 Sentiment & Text Analysis  
- **Depression & Mental Health in the News** (`Depression NYT.ipynb`)  
  - Conducts **NLP-based sentiment analysis** on New York Times articles related to mental health.  
  - Implements `NLTK`, `VADER`, and `TextBlob` to evaluate public sentiment.  

### 📌 AI & Sports Analytics  
- **Dive Video Scoring System** (`SwimDiveVideoScore.ipynb` + `app.py`)  
  - Applies **pose estimation and video frame analysis** to assess the quality of dives in swimming competitions.  
  - Combines `MediaPipe`, `OpenCV`, and `Streamlit` to extract body keypoints, calculate angles, and score each dive.  
  - Includes a **web-based interface** built with `Streamlit` for real-time upload and scoring of dive videos.
